# Sapienza Students Bot

## About the project

The [@SapienzaStudentsBot Telegram Bot](https://telegram.me/) was originally created by the "Sapienza Students" organization and is now maintained by the "Sapienza Students Network" organization. The bot aims to simplify the discovery of Telegram groups dedicated to students of various degree programs and subjects, making it easier for prospective students to find relevant groups.

### The reason behind the choice of Python as programming language

Initially the "Sapienza Students" organization opted for a solution in the GO programming language (whose code is still available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sapienzastudents/antispam-telegram-bot)), recently, with the management of [@SapienzaStudentsBot](https://telegram.me/SapienzaStudentsBot) entrusted to [Matypist](https://github.com/matypist) and [Sapienza Students Network](https://github.com/sapienzastudentsnetwork), it was decided to rewrite the bot from scratch in Python. The reason behind this choice is that Python is a mandatory subject in the Computer Science course at Sapienza, mainly through the teaching of "Fondamenti di Programmazione" in the first semester of the first year of the course, as well as in other Computer Science-related courses available at Sapienza and also most other Italian universities, whereas GO is actually usually only found in teachings at the student's choice. The new aim was therefore the choice of a programming language within the reach of most of the students who will then actually use the bot, so as to facilitate any voluntary collaboration in its development.
